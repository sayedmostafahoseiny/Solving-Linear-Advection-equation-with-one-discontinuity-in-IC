# Solving-Linear-Advection-equation-with-one-discontinuity-in-IC
Solving Linear-Advection equation with one discontinuity in initial condition using "upwind", "Lax", "Lax-Wendroff" , "MacCormack" schemes
The Advection equation is u_t + a*u_x = 0 and a=0.5 is wave speed
Initial condition is u=1 for 0<=x<0.25 and u=0 for 0.25<=x<=1
we solve this equation with one Drichlet B.C and above IC by Finite Differnce discretization
